One day, while they were working, they suddenly felt the house shake violently and realized there was an earthquake. They hurried out of the house, and in an instant, the entire building collapsed. She was unable to stand, terrified and unsure of what to do, and could only lie on the ground, watching as surrounding buildings fell one after another. After the intense shaking passed, the whole town was filled with cries, some calling for help, some screaming. More than two months have passed, but these scenes are still vivid in her mind, sending chills down her spine whenever she recalls them. For over two months, she has not had a single peaceful night’s sleep, frequently waking up in the night; whenever the bed shakes, she wakes up and quickly runs out of the room, thinking there is another earthquake. Please analyze what state this patient is in, what the reasons are, and what the main manifestations are.",
